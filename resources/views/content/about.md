I'm a **full stack software developer** currently working
at [Social Sync](https://socialsync.io) making charity software better. I've also got a soft spot
for [baking bread](https://instagram.com/inbreadcarlisle),
games, movies, and more.

I'm a lover and long-time advocate of [Laravel](https://laravel.com), and a <u>big</u> lover of [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) on
the front-end, but I also have experience with VueJS and Livewire.

So, at 36 years old, after using Laravel since version 3, I made my first contribution to core.

Andâ€¦ it wasnâ€™t even an idea of mine, really, it was an idea from [@joshhanley on Twitter ðŸ§µ](https://x.com/_joshhanley/status/1834012220151529582) that I nerd-sniped so I could try out the contribution process.

I would love to contribute more to open source, as well as build more packages in my little package repository at github.com/intrfce - but I work a lot of hours a day at my job, passionately, to build features, and it doesnâ€™t leave much time for it.

Thanks, Josh & Josh!

Soâ€¦ yeah, the `when()` helper is now in core as a way of printing or returning something when a condition is truthy:

```php
<div {{ when($isTrue, 'wire:poll.5ms="myMethod"') }}>
```

You may or may not know that i like to paint [little plastic spacemen](https://www.warhammer.com/en-GB/plp?search=custodes) as well as software development. I was doing some painting this weekend
and working on my [Deathwatch](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Deathwatch) [Kill Team](https://www.warhammer.com/en-GB/other-games-kill-team-LP), and thought i'd put together a little post of some of my favourite
paints and tools i've found over the past year of picking the hobby back up.

## Vallejo Primers

Let's start at the bottom (layer). These Vallejo primers are simply the best ones i've found, either brushed on or shot through
the airbrush, they leave a flawless base, they dry incredibly quickly, and most importantly, they don't seem to chip off
like other brands I've used.

## Vallejo Metal Colour

These are quite simply the best metallics I've used - along with the other Vallejo metallics further down the list.

They're _thin_ - you can put them straight through the airbrush (i always add two drops of thinner anyway), and you can paint them straight on
and they flow beautifully, the pigments seem to self-level brilliantly so you don't get the "patchy" effect some metallics can give
when you thin them down.

One thing though - avoid the gold one, it's extremely pasty and doesn't look good at all, but I've yet to find one of
the Aluminium or silver ones that doesn't look great.

## John Blanche Paints

The first two John Blanche paint sets from The Army Painter are lovely, but _specifically_ these three I just couldn't live without anymore.

**Grimdark Shadow** has become my Nuln Oil replacement - it dirties up and shades light and dark metallics amazingly, it has tones of
green and brown in there that also look great on lighter colours as well.

**The Darkness** is the _darkest_ blue paint, akin to a dark Payne's Grey, and it can work as a deep dark blue, but can also
be used as a basis of cold blacks, like on my Arbites kill team:

**Blanched Berry** is a dark crimson that I love so much that I wanted to build an entire space marine chapter and it's lore
around:

## Silicoil Brush Cleaning Tank

Apparently this is made for painting with oils and thinners, but it works just as well with Acrylics - you can't really
see it in the picture here, but there's a metal coil in there that allows you to swirl your brush against it to clean
the bristles without damaging them. It's not fancy, it just works. And it's _heavy_ and made of glass, which means
you're less likely to send it skidding off the end of the desk.

## Orange Brushes / Rosemary & Co / Artify Brushes.

My absolute go to brushes for more than 6 months have been the kolinsky sable brushes by Orange brushes - you can see how well
it's held up to being used to paint almost every day for months. Orange brushes also sell a wash brush, but it's a little expensive for 
what it is, and if found that the tip curled almost _immediately_, and i haven't managed to fix it yet.

Instead, I bought the Rosemary & Co `Series 301 - Size 4 Pointed Round Golden Synthetic` - it was £1.94 and it has been 
absolutely unstoppable. I use this for basecoating, washes, contrast paints and more, and it just keeps bouncing back.

And for £2, I can easily justify replacing it!

The drybrush is from the [Artify Drybrush set on Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/ARTIFY-Drybrush-Set-Brushes-Professional-Grade/dp/B0BTGFCM8P?crid=23533VM0ON0O&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.QTrCa4R791_nKuoboo0FdPgc2CaMk74b2kBfJtlNmUJVdLWCS0dkEImDyumhtH-HDraf3carZTMoZS8cHOkKkG6il1OcZvsrI6rHHVfioDTi0knOXqSs22a4QVWuxfsjPlTOkleoa31yibSlJxOwoFnPCK7ZQJ0Hq3AFqXFyRSd6OOI5HXGcyz3BK-4znC6TvogddsGzatg6PguxTTDXRbt4rv9ZMPv1SAILVcWhnvOVBvvkirj-ETu4F-5hi_yVAw8sA9jp_nYSwfUkdqsjSpCQKpsV-Q2R9h6pKqRJYW8.r7QNibbUlzM7A-zXdaFxyaWstnn58W4kALm0NDl5tDU&dib_tag=se&keywords=artify+drybrush+set&qid=1768171895&sprefix=artify+dry,aps,120&sr=8-1) that i got for £19.

It's a great set, and comes with a little sponge to help you use the "not dry" drybrush method popularised by Artis Opus
and a little pot of brush soap to keep them clean.

## Pro Acryl Red Grey

Pro Acryl paints are frickin' awesome, I have a bunch of them, so it seems weird to focus on one particular colour.

But I use this in so many situations - mostly for basecoating underneath warmer colours that might not cover very well
directly over black. This works particularly well for reds, golds and bronzes.

It also works great for scratching up browns to add character to leather.

## Vallejo True Metallic Metal System

I've been painting the Deathwatch Killteam at the top of this post for a while, and I tested a TONNE of recipes for black armour.

What i settled on was the Obsidian shade of the new Vallejo true metallic metal system.

It comes with a base paint (which, like the other Vallejo metallics goes on brilliantly and evenly), then a special shade paint (which i thinned down with some xpress colour medium), and a light colour to add some highlights - easy peasy.

## Sprue Goo!

Sprue goo is just plastic cement with your model sprues chopped up and melted into a goop that acts like thick glue.

It's extremely useful for filling gaps, but also allows you to attach parts with a more substantial grab than just using thin plastic cement by itself.

## Citadel's GOAT shades and contrasts. 

**Reikland Fleshshade** is touted as being for skin tones, and it does a wonderful job of that, BUT, it's real use comes for shading golds and brass metallic colours - I use it on my custodes and it's just the best, it brings a warm reddy tone that absolutely brings it to life.

**Frostheart** is hands down my favourite contrast paint they make - it works on power weapons, eye lenses, buttons, lights, everything, the colour is just superb.

## The Personal Stuff

- Above all, i'm thankful for my partner, Charlotte, she puts up with me, two dogs, a crippling [Warhammer](https://www.warhammer.com/) addiction, and my inevitible tiredness and stressed out state when a long day at work leaves me feeling drained.
- I'm thankful for our new [(canine) addition to the family](https://www.instagram.com/p/DQrlIMiCvzl/). She's so cute, you can tell she's going to be a great pupper.
- I'm thankful for the group of people at [The Guild Coworking space](https://www.theguildcoworking.co.uk/), who are my physical 'work family', and also the group of people that i share beers with, play D&D with, play Warhammer games with, go to see movies with, and more. Having a community like this is a lifesaver for someone who would otherwise be working at home, by themselves, for 50+ hours a week.
- As annoyingly expensive as it is, i'm thankful I have the time to build, paint and play warhammer - sitting listening to a podcast and painting tiny little plastic spacemen is the best way i've found to unwind from the always-online life that being a software engineer causes you to live. (Big shout out to [Element Games](https://elementgames.co.uk/) for being the best place to buy mini painting stuff!).

## Work things.

- I've already mentioned this in a post over on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7407718968460726272/) where I could tag them, so they know this - but I'm thankful for my dev team at [Social Sync](https://socialsync.app) - Ayoub, Abdullah, Eric and Richard. I'm an engineering manager who's been very much learning on the job, and they have been the most patient and supportive group I could have asked for, along with being kick-ass developers, and supportive friends.
- I'm greatful for the Laravel community, particularly to the folks behind Laravel Live UK for running a conference that reminds me every year how lucky I am to be part of this group of people. I'm thankful to [Chris Morrell](https://bsky.app/profile/cmorrell.com) for having me on [his podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReYU6YkhLbE), and for [John Rudolph Drexler](https://bsky.app/profile/cmorrell.com) for helping me work through the challenges of managing a small team both on and off the podcast.
- As stressful as this year has been, i'm thankful for the awesome work we've done at [Social Sync](https://socialsync.io), and the fact that (as of today, 23rd December) we've raised over £5 million pounds for charities via our platform alone.

## "Things" i'm 'thankful' for.

> Note: I put 'thankful' in quotes here because I don't want to cheapen the genuine gratitude I feel for the other things - this more just a list of stuff I think is neat.

- I bought a [Steam Deck](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck) and I truly think it's one of the best purchases i've ever made - i'm not sure how I ever lived without it. I can sit on the sofa and game without isolating myself from my partner of an evening, it excels at pick-up-and-play, which is my preferred style of gaming these days (or rather, all I have time for). I'm currently playing [Rogue Trader](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2186680/Warhammer_40000_Rogue_Trader/) as it was on sale on Steam - it should keep me going right through Christmas.
- This year I bought a month of [YouTube Premium](https://www.youtube.com/premium?ybp=Sg0IBhIJdW5saW1pdGVk4AEB) for £1, totally meaning to cancel it. But... I just couldn't, no ads! And for the amount of YouTube I watch, including longer form stuff, it's a game changer.
- I sold my larger 3D printer and bought a compact [A1 Mini](https://uk.store.bambulab.com/products/a1-mini) - and even though i totally want a bigger printer again in the future when i've got the room, this thing kicks so much arse, for [practical stuff](https://makerworld.com/en/models/408452-ikea-skadis-tp-link-deco-x50-router-mount?from=search#profileId-310411) to being able to print things for friends, I genuinely don't know how I could do without it now.
- I'm not kidding, this [stupid little £16 heat pad](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0DG2MVDX6?th=1) has changed my life. My feet have never been so warm in bed at night.
- Oh, and again, not kidding, [this £5 brush](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000J1AD52) is the best thing i've ever bought for my beard - it's like getting a massage every time I use it.
